# Markdown Documentation

I would rather write my documentation inside a text editor than work or some other work processor.  Here are a few small tools that I have put together to to be able to make pretty nice documents.

## Prerequisites

  1. rdiscount
  2. hpricot
  
## How to use

  1. write your document in markdown using the markdown extension.
  2. run "rake" to build all of your documents.  An html file will result, which is self contained and able to be emailed out. (except images)
  
## TODO

  1. I would like to be able to include images in my single html file.
  2. Prettier.  More looks.
